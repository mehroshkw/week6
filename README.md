Flutter Supported Platforms and App Performance
I created this Flutter app to showcase the different platforms that Flutter supports and the best practices for optimizing app performance. The app includes screens that cover flutter supported platfoms infromation and app performance infromation.

Supported Platforms
The app includes screens that demonstrate how to work with Flutter on the following platforms:

Android
iOS
Desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux)
Web
Each platform screen includes information on how to set up the development environment, run the app on the platform, and any platform-specific considerations to keep in mind.

App Performance

State management
Image optimization
Network calls and caching
Profiling and debugging
The Impeller update is a new performance optimization tool in Flutter that can help improve app startup time and reduce memory usage. 
The performance screens also include information on how to use Impeller in your app.

Conclusion
This app includes infromation about how app performance works and why it is important.
